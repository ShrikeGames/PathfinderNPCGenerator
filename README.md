# Pathfinder Level 1 NPC Generator
Generates nearly completely random level 1 NPCs for Pathfinder RPG.

This is just meant to be a quick, dirty and functional implementation. There's a hundred better ways to do it, and this is only designed for the specific use-case.
* There are 5 NPC classes you can get: Adept, Aristocrat, Commoner, Expert, Warrior
* There are 9 races you can get: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Human, Orc
* Each character gets a drawback! There are lots of them.
* Assigns random feats (from a small list)
* Racial traits that always apply are applied to the character sheet
* Reasonably large lists of random names for each race and gender 
* Genders, heights, and weights according to the regular old boring random tables (with room to add whatever we want).
* Genders are randomly Male, Female, or "Other". If "Other" they have a chance to get Male and/or Female-specific results for the rest of the character generation.
* Stats are rolled randomly using 3d6 for each stat.

Drunk Pathfinder Rules!
* Generate 25-50 random NPC character sheets.
* Get a party of 4-5 players together to go through a dungeon.
* If their character dies they have to finish their drink before they get another character.
* If they take damage they take a drink.
* If they role a natural 1 they take a drink.
* If they role a natural 20 they can assign a drink to someone.
* The dungeon is extremely deadly! Full of traps and mobs of monsters.
* Oh and did I mention you spawn with no equipment at all? Have fun punching things to death until you find some!
* Dungeon not included.

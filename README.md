# PathfinderNPCGenerator
Generates nearly completely random level 1 NPCs for Pathfinder RPG.

This is just meant to be a quick, dirty and functional implementation. There's a hundred better ways to do it, and this is only designed for the specific use-case.
* There are 5 NPC classes you can get: Adept, Aristocrat, Commoner, Expert, Warrior
* There are 9 races you can get: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Human, Orc
* Each character gets a drawback! There are lots of them.
* Assigns random feats (from a very small list)
* Racial traits that always apply are applied to the character sheet
* Random names, genders, heights and weights according to the regular old boring random tables (with room to add whatever we want).

Drunk Pathfinder Rules!
* Generate 25-50 random NPC character sheets
* Get a party of 4-5 players together to go through a dungeon
* If their character dies they finish their drink and get another character
* If they take damage they take a drink
* If they role a natural 1 they take a drink
* If they role a natural 20 they can assign a drink to someone
* The dungeon is extremely deadly! Full of traps and mobs of monsters.
* Oh and did I mention you go spawn with no equipment at all? Have fun punching things to death until you find some!
